These also offer job security for a lifetime, and hence a lot of youth prefer them. Getting into a Government job requires a person to go through multiple levels of tests. These include a written examination, interview and sometimes even physical examination. These are competitive exams, and millions of people appear for these exams to get into a coveted Government job.
